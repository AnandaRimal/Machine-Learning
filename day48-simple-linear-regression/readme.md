# Simple Linear Regression

## 1. Introduction
**Simple Linear Regression** is the "Hello World" of Machine Learning. It's the simplest algorithm to predict a numerical value (Regression).
It assumes a linear relationship between one input variable ($X$) and one output variable ($y$).
The goal? Find the best straight line that fits the data.

## 2. Conceptual Deep Dive

### The Equation
$$ y = mx + b $$
- **$y$**: The target (what we want to predict).
- **$x$**: The feature (input).
- **$m$**: The slope (weight/coefficient). How much $y$ changes for a unit change in $x$.
- **$b$**: The intercept (bias). The value of $y$ when $x=0$.

### The Goal: "Best Fit"
How do we define the "best" line? We want the line that is closest to all the points.
Mathematically, we minimize the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**:
$$ SSE = \sum (y_{actual} - y_{predicted})^2 $$
This method is called **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**.

## 3. Visualizing the Concept
*(Imagine a line moving up and down, rotating until the total distance to all blue dots is minimized generated by the Nano Banana Model)*

## 4. Practical Implementation & Notebook Walkthrough

The notebook `Untitled.ipynb` uses a Placement dataset (CGPA vs. Package).

### 4.1 Using Scikit-Learn
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 4.2 Prediction
Once trained, the model has learned the optimal `m` (slope) and `b` (intercept).
```python
# Predict for a new student
lr.predict(X_test)
```

### 4.3 Visualizing the Fit
The notebook plots the training data (scatter) and the learned regression line (red line).
```python
plt.scatter(df['cgpa'], df['package'])
plt.plot(X_train, lr.predict(X_train), color='red')
```

## 5. Summary
Simple Linear Regression is fast, interpretable, and the foundation for more complex algorithms. However, it assumes a straight-line relationship, which is rare in the real world.
