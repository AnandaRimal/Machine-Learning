# Bivariate Analysis

## 1. Introduction
While Univariate Analysis looks at variables in isolation, **Bivariate Analysis** explores the relationship between **two** variables. This is where the story of the data begins to unfold. We move from "What is the average age?" to "Does age affect survival chance?". This chapter covers the essential plotting techniques to uncover these hidden connections.

## 2. Conceptual Deep Dive

### The Three Interaction Types
The choice of visualization depends entirely on the data types of the two variables being compared:

1.  **Numerical vs. Numerical**:
    - **Goal**: Find correlation or trends.
    - **Tools**: Scatterplot, Lineplot.

2.  **Numerical vs. Categorical**:
    - **Goal**: Compare distributions across groups.
    - **Tools**: Barplot, Boxplot, Distplot (with hue).

3.  **Categorical vs. Categorical**:
    - **Goal**: Find associations or contingency.
    - **Tools**: Heatmap, Crosstab, Stacked Bar Chart.

### Multivariate Analysis
We can often extend these 2D plots to 3D or 4D by adding visual cues like **Color (Hue)**, **Size**, and **Style**. This allows us to see how a third or fourth variable interacts with the primary pair.

## 3. Visualizing the Concept

## 4. Practical Implementation & Notebook Walkthrough

The notebook `day21.ipynb` uses multiple datasets (Tips, Titanic, Flights, Iris) to demonstrate the versatility of Seaborn.

### 4.1 Numerical - Numerical
**Scatterplot:**
The gold standard for correlation.
```python
sns.scatterplot(tips['total_bill'], tips['tip'], hue=tips['sex'], style=tips['smoker'], size=tips['size'])
```
*Insight*: We see a positive correlation (as bill increases, tip increases). The `hue`, `style`, and `size` parameters add layers of depth, showing how gender, smoking status, and party size affect this relationship.

### 4.2 Numerical - Categorical
**Bar Plot:**
Plots the mean (or other aggregate) of a numerical variable for each category.
```python
sns.barplot(titanic['Pclass'], titanic['Age'], hue=titanic['Sex'])
```
*Insight*: We can compare the average age across different passenger classes and genders.

**Box Plot:**
Compares the spread and outliers of a numerical variable across categories.
```python
sns.boxplot(titanic['Sex'], titanic['Age'], hue=titanic['Survived'])
```
*Insight*: Did younger males survive more than older males? The boxplot reveals the distribution differences.

**Distplot (with Hue):**
Overlays density curves for different categories.
```python
sns.distplot(titanic[titanic['Survived']==0]['Age'], hist=False)
sns.distplot(titanic[titanic['Survived']==1]['Age'], hist=False)
```
*Insight*: If the curves are separated, the variable is a good predictor. Here, we see a spike in survival for infants.

### 4.3 Categorical - Categorical
**Heatmap (Crosstab):**
Visualizes the frequency of intersections.
```python
sns.heatmap(pd.crosstab(titanic['Pclass'], titanic['Survived']))
```
*Insight*: Shows which combination (e.g., 3rd Class & Died) has the highest count.

### 4.4 Special Plots
**Pairplot:**
A brute-force approach that plots every numerical variable against every other numerical variable.
```python
sns.pairplot(iris, hue='species')
```
*Insight*: Instantly reveals clusters and separable classes in the data.

**Lineplot:**
Essential for time-series data.
```python
sns.lineplot(flights['year'], flights['passengers'])
```
*Insight*: Shows the trend (growth) and seasonality (yearly cycles) of air travel.

## 5. Summary
Bivariate analysis is the detective work of Data Science. It allows you to hypothesize relationships ("I bet rich people survived more") and prove or disprove them with data ("The barplot confirms 1st class had higher survival").
