# Descriptive Statistics

## 1. Introduction
Once data is loaded, the first step is not modeling, but **understanding**. Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the dataset's main characteristics. This chapter covers the essential Pandas functions to inspect data types, missing values, and statistical distributions.

## 2. Conceptual Deep Dive

### The 5-Point Summary
For any numerical variable, we need to know:
1.  **Central Tendency**: Where is the center? (Mean, Median, Mode)
2.  **Dispersion**: How spread out is it? (Standard Deviation, Variance)
3.  **Shape**: Is it symmetrical? (Skewness, Kurtosis)

### Data Types (Dtypes)
Understanding types is crucial:
- **Numerical**: Continuous (Height) or Discrete (Count).
- **Categorical**: Nominal (Color) or Ordinal (Rank).
- **Datetime**: Time-series data.

### Missingness
Data is rarely perfect. We must quantify **Null** values to decide on imputation strategies later.

## 3. Visualizing the Concept

## 4. Practical Implementation & Notebook Walkthrough

The notebook `day19.ipynb` uses the **Titanic** dataset to demonstrate these concepts.

### 4.1 High-Level Overview
```python
df.shape  # (Rows, Columns)
df.head() # First 5 rows
df.sample(5) # Random 5 rows (crucial for checking bias)
```

### 4.2 Data Health Check (`info`)
The `df.info()` function is the MRI of your dataframe.
```python
df.info()
```
It reveals:
- Missing values (Non-Null count).
- Data types (int64, float64, object).
- Memory usage.

### 4.3 Mathematical Summary (`describe`)
```python
df.describe()
```
This outputs the count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, and max for all numerical columns. It helps spot outliers (e.g., if max Age is 200).

### 4.4 Correlation Analysis
```python
df.corr()['Survived']
```
We check how features relate to the target.
- **Positive Correlation**: As X increases, Y increases.
- **Negative Correlation**: As X increases, Y decreases.

### 4.5 Categorical Analysis
For non-numerical columns, we use `value_counts()` to see the frequency distribution.
```python
df['Embarked'].value_counts()
```

## 5. Summary
Descriptive statistics are the "vital signs" of your data. They tell you if the patient (dataset) is healthy enough for surgery (machine learning).
