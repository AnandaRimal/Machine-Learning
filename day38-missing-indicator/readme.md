# Missing Indicator

## 1. Introduction
When we impute data (e.g., with the Mean), we lose a crucial piece of information: **"This value was originally missing."**
The fact that a value is missing might be predictive in itself. For example, a patient refusing to disclose their weight might indicate a specific health condition. The **Missing Indicator** technique explicitly tells the model which values were imputed.

## 2. Conceptual Deep Dive

### The Hybrid Approach
Instead of just imputing, we do two things:
1.  **Impute** the missing value (e.g., with Mean).
2.  **Add a binary column** (0 or 1) indicating if the value was missing.

This gives the model the best of both worlds: a complete dataset to work with, and the knowledge of which data points are "fake" (imputed).

## 3. Visualizing the Concept
*(Imagine a table here generated by the Nano Banana Model: Column A has values [10, NaN, 30]. It transforms into Column A [10, 20, 30] AND Column A_missing [0, 1, 0])*

## 4. Practical Implementation & Notebook Walkthrough

The notebook `missing-indicator.ipynb` uses the Titanic dataset.

### 4.1 Using `MissingIndicator`
Scikit-Learn provides a dedicated class for this.
```python
from sklearn.impute import MissingIndicator

mi = MissingIndicator()
X_train_missing = mi.fit_transform(X_train)
```
This returns a boolean matrix indicating missing locations.

### 4.2 Using `SimpleImputer` with `add_indicator`
A more convenient way is to use `SimpleImputer` directly.
```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# impute with mean AND add indicator column
si = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean', add_indicator=True)

X_train_trf = si.fit_transform(X_train)
```

### 4.3 Does it help?
The notebook compares Logistic Regression accuracy:
- **Without Indicator**: Accuracy ~63%
- **With Indicator**: Accuracy ~64%
In this specific case, the improvement is marginal, but in datasets where missingness is not random (MNAR), this technique can significantly boost performance.

## 5. Summary
Adding a Missing Indicator increases the dimensionality of your data (adds more columns), but it makes your imputation "transparent" to the model. It's a low-risk, potential-reward strategy.
