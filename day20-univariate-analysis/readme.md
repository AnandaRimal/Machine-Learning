# Univariate Analysis

## 1. Introduction
Data analysis begins with the simplest possible question: "What does this one variable look like?" **Univariate Analysis** is the examination of a single variable in isolation. It is the foundation upon which all complex modeling is built. If you don't understand the distribution of your target variable or the skewness of your features, your models will be built on shaky ground.

## 2. Conceptual Deep Dive

### The Two Pillars of Data
Data comes in two primary flavors, and each requires a different analytical approach:

1.  **Categorical Data**: Qualitative data describing groups or categories (e.g., Gender, Country, Yes/No).
    - **Goal**: To understand the frequency or proportion of each category.
    - **Tools**: Countplots, Pie Charts.

2.  **Numerical Data**: Quantitative data representing measurements or counts (e.g., Age, Salary, Temperature).
    - **Goal**: To understand the central tendency, spread, and shape of the distribution.
    - **Tools**: Histograms, Distplots, Boxplots.

### Key Statistical Concepts
- **Frequency Distribution**: How often does each value occur?
- **Central Tendency**: Where is the "center" of the data? (Mean, Median, Mode).
- **Dispersion**: How spread out is the data? (Range, Variance, Standard Deviation).
- **Skewness**: Is the data symmetrical, or does it lean to one side?
- **Kurtosis**: How "tailed" is the data? (Heavy tails imply more outliers).

## 3. Visualizing the Concept
*(Imagine a dashboard here generated by the Nano Banana Model showing a side-by-side comparison of a Normal Distribution vs. a Skewed Distribution, and a Bar Chart vs. a Pie Chart)*

## 4. Practical Implementation & Notebook Walkthrough

The notebook `day20.ipynb` uses the Titanic dataset to demonstrate these techniques.

### 4.1 Analyzing Categorical Data
**Countplot:**
The most basic visualization. It simply counts the number of observations in each category.
```python
sns.countplot(df['Embarked'])
```
*Insight*: We can instantly see which port was the most common embarkation point.

**Pie Chart:**
Useful for showing parts of a whole, though often criticized for being hard to read if there are too many slices.
```python
df['Sex'].value_counts().plot(kind='pie', autopct='%.2f')
```
*Insight*: Shows the exact percentage split between Male and Female passengers.

### 4.2 Analyzing Numerical Data
**Histogram:**
Bins the data into intervals and counts the observations per bin. It gives a rough sense of the density.
```python
plt.hist(df['Age'], bins=5)
```

**Distplot (Distribution Plot):**
A superior version of the histogram that overlays a **Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)** line. This smooth curve represents the probability density function.
```python
sns.distplot(df['Age'])
```
*Insight*: We can see if the age distribution is bell-shaped (Normal) or skewed.

**Boxplot:**
The ultimate tool for detecting **outliers**. It visualizes the 5-number summary: Minimum, First Quartile (Q1), Median, Third Quartile (Q3), and Maximum.
```python
sns.boxplot(df['Age'])
```
*Insight*: Points outside the "whiskers" are statistical outliers (e.g., very old passengers).

## 5. Summary
Univariate analysis is the "getting to know you" phase of data science. It reveals the personality of each variable, highlighting potential issues like outliers, missing data, or extreme skewness that must be addressed before modeling.
