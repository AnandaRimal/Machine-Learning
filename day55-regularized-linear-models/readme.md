# Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

## 1. Introduction
When you have too many features or too little data, Linear Regression tends to **Overfit**. It learns the noise in the training data, leading to wild predictions on test data.
**Ridge Regression** fixes this by imposing a penalty on the size of the coefficients. It forces the model to be "simple".

## 2. Conceptual Deep Dive

### The Cost Function
Standard OLS minimizes Error. Ridge minimizes **Error + Penalty**.
$$ J = \sum (y - \hat{y})^2 + \lambda \sum \beta^2 $$
- **$\lambda$ (Lambda/Alpha)**: The strength of the penalty.
- **$\sum \beta^2$**: The sum of squared coefficients (L2 Norm).

### How it works
The model wants to minimize error (fit the data), but the penalty term screams "Don't let the coefficients get too big!".
The result is a compromise: a line that fits the data reasonably well but is much smoother and less sensitive to noise.

## 3. Visualizing the Concept
*(Imagine a graph where the coefficients shrink towards zero as Lambda increases, but never quite reach zero generated by the Nano Banana Model)*

## 4. Practical Implementation & Notebook Walkthrough

The notebook `Ridge Regularization.ipynb` uses the Diabetes dataset.

### 4.1 Ridge in Scikit-Learn
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

# alpha is the lambda parameter
reg = Ridge(alpha=0.1)
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 4.2 The Effect of Alpha
The notebook demonstrates that as you increase `alpha`:
1.  The coefficients (`reg.coef_`) get smaller.
2.  The model moves from Overfitting (High Variance) to Underfitting (High Bias).
3.  There is a "sweet spot" for alpha that gives the best R2 score.

## 5. Summary
Ridge Regression is your default choice when you suspect overfitting. It's stable, differentiable, and handles multicollinearity (correlated features) exceptionally well.
