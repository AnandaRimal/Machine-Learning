# Complete Case Analysis (CCA)

## 1. Introduction
Missing data is a nightmare. The simplest (and most aggressive) way to handle it is **Complete Case Analysis (CCA)**, also known as "Listwise Deletion". It simply means: **Delete any row that has a missing value**. If a row isn't "complete", we ignore it.

## 2. Conceptual Deep Dive

### When to use CCA?
CCA is only safe to use if:
1.  **Data is Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)**: The missingness has no pattern and is unrelated to any other variable.
2.  **Missing data is small**: Usually, if less than 5% of the data is missing, CCA is acceptable.

### The Risks
- **Data Loss**: If you have many columns with small amounts of missing data, you might end up deleting 50% of your rows.
- **Bias**: If the data is *not* MCAR (e.g., rich people refuse to share their salary), deleting those rows introduces bias.

## 3. Visualizing the Concept
*(Imagine a filter here generated by the Nano Banana Model: Rows with holes fall through the cracks, only solid rows remain)*

## 4. Practical Implementation & Notebook Walkthrough

The notebook `day35.ipynb` uses the `data_science_job.csv` dataset.

### 4.1 Identifying Candidates for CCA
We look for columns with < 5% missing data.
```python
cols = [var for var in df.columns if df[var].isnull().mean() < 0.05 and df[var].isnull().mean() > 0]
```

### 4.2 Dropping Rows
```python
new_df = df[cols].dropna()
```
We compare the shape of `df` vs `new_df` to see how much data we lost.

### 4.3 Verifying Distribution
**Crucial Step**: We must check if dropping rows changed the distribution of the data. We plot histograms of the original vs. the new data.
```python
# Overlay histograms
df['training_hours'].hist(color='red', density=True)
new_df['training_hours'].hist(color='green', density=True, alpha=0.8)
```
*Insight*: If the red and green histograms overlap perfectly, CCA was safe. If they diverge, we introduced bias.

## 5. Summary
CCA is the "nuclear option" for missing data. It's quick and easy, but use it with caution. Always verify that you haven't broken the statistical properties of your dataset.
