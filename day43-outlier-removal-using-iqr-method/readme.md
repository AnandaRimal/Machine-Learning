# Outlier Removal using IQR Method

## 1. Introduction
What if your data isn't Normally Distributed? What if it's skewed? The Z-Score method fails there.
Enter the **IQR (Interquartile Range) Method**. It relies on boxplot statistics (percentiles) rather than Mean and Standard Deviation, making it robust to skewed distributions.

## 2. Conceptual Deep Dive

### The Boxplot Anatomy
- **Q1 (25th Percentile)**: 25% of data is below this.
- **Q3 (75th Percentile)**: 75% of data is below this.
- **IQR**: The middle 50% of the data ($Q3 - Q1$).

### The Formula
We define outliers as data points that fall outside the "whiskers":
- **Upper Limit**: $Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR$
- **Lower Limit**: $Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR$

Why 1.5? It's a statistical convention that corresponds roughly to $\pm 2.7\sigma$ in a normal distribution.

## 3. Visualizing the Concept
*(Imagine a skewed distribution here generated by the Nano Banana Model: A long tail to the right. The Z-score method would miss the outliers, but the IQR method correctly identifies the extreme tail)*

## 4. Practical Implementation & Notebook Walkthrough

The notebook `day43.ipynb` uses the same placement dataset but focuses on the skewed `placement_exam_marks` column.

### 4.1 Calculating IQR
```python
Q1 = df['placement_exam_marks'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['placement_exam_marks'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
```

### 4.2 Defining Limits
```python
upper_limit = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
lower_limit = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
```

### 4.3 Trimming vs. Capping
Just like with Z-Score, we can either drop the rows (Trimming) or cap the values to the limits (Capping). Capping is often preferred to preserve data volume.

## 5. Summary
The IQR method is the "Swiss Army Knife" of outlier detection. It works for both normal and skewed distributions and is the logic behind the standard Boxplot.
