# Automated Data Profiling with pandas-profiling (ydata-profiling)

## 1. Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial but repetitive. **ydata-profiling** (formerly **pandas-profiling**) automates EDA by generating an interactive HTML report covering distributions, correlations, missingness, and warnings.

## 2. Conceptual Deep Dive

### What It Computes
- Types: boolean, numeric, categorical inference
- Descriptive stats: mean, median, std, skew, kurtosis
- Quantiles: min, max, Q1, Q3, IQR
- Missingness: counts and patterns
- Correlations: Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, Phik, Cramér’s V
- Duplicates and alerts: high cardinality, constant columns, leakage hints

### df.describe() vs Profiling
Profiling adds visuals, categorical analysis, correlations, and warnings beyond `df.describe()`.

## 3. Visualizing the Concept
Flow: Raw CSV → Profiling Engine → HTML Report with Charts, Alerts, Stats.

## 4. Practical Implementation

### 4.1 Installation
```python
# In a notebook cell
%pip install ydata-profiling
```

### 4.2 Generate the Report
```python
import pandas as pd
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport

df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
profile = ProfileReport(df, title='Training Data Profile', explorative=True)
profile.to_file('output.html')
```

### 4.3 Tips
- Sample rows for very large datasets; exclude IDs and extremely high-cardinality columns.
- Review correlations, duplicates, and missingness sections; act on detected issues.

## 5. Summary
ydata-profiling accelerates EDA. Use it to triage dataset health, then perform targeted manual analysis aligned to your modeling goals.
