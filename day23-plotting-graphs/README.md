# Plotting Graphs in Statistics: Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis

## 1. Introduction
Visualization is the heart of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. Before feeding data into any Machine Learning model, we must understand its shape, structure, and relationships. This chapter provides a deep dive into the three levels of analysis: **Univariate** (one variable), **Bivariate** (two variables), and **Multivariate** (three+ variables), explaining *why* each plot matters for ML.

# ⭐ PART 1 — UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS

**Univariate** analysis focuses on a single feature at a time.
**Goal**: Understand distribution, shape, outliers, and frequency.

## 1. Categorical Data (Univariate)
Variables representing groups (e.g., Gender, Placed/Not Placed, Region).

### A. Bar Chart
Shows the **frequency** (count) of each category.

![Bar Chart showing category counts generated by Nano Banana Model](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Bar+Chart+by+Nano+Banana+Model)

**Visual Intuition**:
```
Placed       ██████████████████████████ 70
Not Placed   ██████████████ 30
```

**Why use it?**
- Easy comparison of category sizes.
- Crucial for detecting **Class Imbalance**.

**ML Relevance**:
- **Imbalance Detection**: If "Not Placed" is very rare, accuracy might be misleading. You might need techniques like SMOTE or Oversampling.
- **Baseline Accuracy**: Helps set expectations (e.g., "If I predict 'Placed' for everyone, I get 70% accuracy").

### B. Pie Chart
Shows **percentage** contribution of each category.

**Visual Intuition**:
```
        _________
     .-'         '-.
   .'   70% Placed  '.
  /  30% Not Placed   \
  \                   /
   '.               .'
     '-._________.-'
```

**ML Relevance**:
- Rarely used in strict ML pipelines, but useful for stakeholder presentations to show market share or class proportions.

## 2. Numerical Data (Univariate)
Variables representing quantities (e.g., Age, Salary, CGPA).

### A. Histogram
Bins continuous data into intervals and counts the frequency in each bin.

![Histogram showing data distribution generated by Nano Banana Model](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Histogram+by+Nano+Banana+Model)

**Visual Intuition**:
```
20k–30k | ████
30k–40k | ███████████
40k–50k | ██████████████████ (Mode)
50k–60k | ████████████
60k–70k | ██████
```

**ML Relevance**:
- **Normality Check**: Many algorithms (Linear Regression, Gaussian NB) assume Normal distribution. If the histogram is skewed, apply **Log Transform**.
- **Outlier Detection**: Bars far from the main group indicate anomalies.

### B. Density Plot (KDE)
Kernel Density Estimation. A smoothed version of the histogram.

![KDE Plot showing smooth probability density generated by Nano Banana Model](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=KDE+Plot+by+Nano+Banana+Model)

**Visual Intuition**:
```
              __----__
          _--'        '--_
       _-'               '--_
   ___-'                    '--___
```

**ML Relevance**:
- **Probability Density**: Helps visualize the probability of a variable falling within a range.
- **Bimodality**: Reveals if data has two underlying groups (e.g., two peaks might mean two different customer segments).

### C. Box Plot
Visualizes the **5-Number Summary**: Min, Q1 (25%), Median (50%), Q3 (75%), Max.

![Box Plot showing quartiles and outliers generated by Nano Banana Model](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Box+Plot+by+Nano+Banana+Model)

**Visual Intuition**:
```
    |-----------IQR-----------|
 Q1     Median          Q3

----|-------[====]--------|------
 min                         max    * (Outlier)
```

**ML Relevance**:
- **Outlier Removal**: Points outside the "whiskers" are candidates for removal or capping (Winsorization).
- **Spread**: Shows the variance of the data robustly.

# ⭐ PART 2 — BIVARIATE ANALYSIS

**Bivariate** analysis explores the relationship between **two variables**.
**Goal**: Find correlations, trends, and associations.

## 1. Categorical – Categorical

### A. Clustered Bar Chart
Compares counts of one category split by another.

**Visual Intuition**:
```
            Placed    Not Placed
Male        ██████     ████
Female      █████████  ██
```

### B. Heatmap (Crosstab)
A color-coded contingency table.

![Heatmap showing correlation between categories generated by Nano Banana Model](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Categorical+Heatmap+by+Nano+Banana+Model)

**ML Relevance**:
- **Feature Interaction**: Reveals if two categorical features combined have a strong effect on the target (e.g., "Female" AND "Placed" is a common pattern).

## 2. Numerical – Numerical

### A. Scatter Plot
Plots every data point as a dot (x, y).

![Scatter Plot showing correlation generated by Nano Banana Model](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Scatter+Plot+by+Nano+Banana+Model)

**Visual Intuition**:
```
Salary ↑
       |     ●   ●
       |   ● ● ●
       | ● ●
       |_________________→ IQ
```

**ML Relevance**:
- **Correlation**: Positive (upward slope), Negative (downward), or None (cloud).
- **Linearity**: Checks if a Linear Regression model will work. If curved, you need **Polynomial Features**.
- **Clusters**: Visualizes natural groupings for K-Means.

### B. Line Graph
Connects points in order. Primarily for **Time Series**.

**Visual Intuition**:
```
Price ↑
130 |      /‾‾\__
120 |   __/
110 |__/
     ---------------- Time →
```

**ML Relevance**:
- **Trend Analysis**: Detects seasonality and long-term trends in forecasting problems.

## 3. Categorical – Numerical

### A. Box Plot (Grouped)
Compares distributions across groups.

**Visual Intuition**:
```
Male:    |--[====]----|
Female:  |----[===]--|
```

**ML Relevance**:
- **Feature Importance**: If the box plots for "Placed" vs "Not Placed" are at very different heights for "CGPA", then "CGPA" is a **strong predictor**.

### B. Violin Plot
Combines Box Plot and KDE. Shows the density shape for each group.

# ⭐ PART 3 — MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS

**Multivariate** analysis involves **three or more variables**.
**Goal**: Understand complex interactions.

## 1. 3D Scatter Plot
Adds a Z-axis.

![3D Scatter Plot generated by Nano Banana Model](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=3D+Scatter+Plot+by+Nano+Banana+Model)

**ML Relevance**:
- **Hyperplane Visualization**: Helps understand how SVMs or Linear Models separate classes in higher dimensions.

## 2. Hue Parameter (Seaborn)
Uses **Color** to represent a 3rd categorical variable on a 2D plot.

**Visual Intuition**:
```
● = Placed (Blue)
○ = Not Placed (Red)

Salary ↑
   ● ● ○
   ● ● ○ ○
   _________________→ IQ
```

**ML Relevance**:
- **Separability**: If Blue and Red dots are mixed, the features (IQ, Salary) are not enough to separate the classes. If they are distinct clusters, the model will perform well.

## 3. Pair Plot
A grid of scatter plots for every pair of numerical variables.

![Pair Plot matrix generated by Nano Banana Model](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Pair+Plot+Matrix+by+Nano+Banana+Model)

**ML Relevance**:
- **Multicollinearity**: If "CGPA" and "Grades" show a perfect line, you should drop one to avoid instability in Linear Models.
- **Overview**: The "Bird's Eye View" of the dataset.

## 4. FacetGrid
Creates a grid of plots based on categorical columns.

**Visual Intuition**:
```
Dept A: |‾‾‾-----|  
Dept B: |------|  
Dept C: |---‾‾‾‾|  
```

## 5. Bubble Plot
Uses **Size** to represent a 3rd numerical variable.

**Visual Intuition**:
```
● small → less experience  
●●● big → more experience  

Salary ↑
  ●     ●●       ●●●

# ⭐ SUMMARY: Why Plots Matter in ML

1.  **Data Quality**: Detects garbage values and outliers immediately.
2.  **Algorithm Selection**:
    - Linear pattern? -> Linear Regression.
    - Complex blobs? -> KNN / SVM / Decision Trees.
3.  **Feature Engineering**:
    - Skewed? -> Log Transform.
    - Bimodal? -> Binning.
4.  **Model Debugging**: Understanding why a model fails often starts with visualizing the data it failed on.

Visualization is not just "making pretty pictures"; it is the **diagnostic tool** of the Data Scientist.
