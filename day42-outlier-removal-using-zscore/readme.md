# Outlier Removal using Z-Score

## 1. Introduction
An **outlier** is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. Like a 7-foot tall person in a kindergarten class, they skew your statistics (mean, variance) and confuse your models.
The **Z-Score method** is a technique to detect outliers in **Normally Distributed** data.

## 2. Conceptual Deep Dive

### What is a Z-Score?
A Z-score tells you how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean.
$$ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} $$
- If $Z = 0$, the value is exactly the mean.
- If $Z = +3$, the value is 3 standard deviations above the mean.

### The Rule of Thumb
In a Normal Distribution:
- 68% of data falls within $\mu \pm 1\sigma$
- 95% of data falls within $\mu \pm 2\sigma$
- **99.7% of data falls within $\mu \pm 3\sigma$**

Therefore, any data point with a Z-score > 3 or < -3 is considered an outlier.

## 3. Visualizing the Concept
*(Imagine a Bell Curve here generated by the Nano Banana Model: The central 99.7% is green, and the tiny tails beyond 3-sigma are red zones)*

## 4. Practical Implementation & Notebook Walkthrough

The notebook `day42.ipynb` uses a student placement dataset.

### 4.1 Checking Normality
First, we must verify the data is normally distributed using `sns.distplot()`. If it's skewed, Z-score is not the right tool (use IQR instead).

### 4.2 Calculating Boundaries
We define the upper and lower limits:
```python
upper_limit = df['cgpa'].mean() + 3 * df['cgpa'].std()
lower_limit = df['cgpa'].mean() - 3 * df['cgpa'].std()
```

### 4.3 Handling Outliers
We have two choices:
1.  **Trimming**: Remove the rows completely.
    ```python
    new_df = df[(df['cgpa'] < upper_limit) & (df['cgpa'] > lower_limit)]
    ```
2.  **Capping**: Replace the outliers with the limit values (Winsorization).
    ```python
    df['cgpa'] = np.where(df['cgpa'] > upper_limit, upper_limit, df['cgpa'])
    ```

## 5. Summary
Z-Score is the standard outlier detection method for Gaussian (Normal) data. It assumes that "extreme" means "far from the mean".
